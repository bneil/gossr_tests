# OPtiMuL :: CloverDB and HTMX Experimentation App

This web application is designed to allow developers to experiment with CloverDB and HTMX,
two powerful technologies used for building dynamic, reactive web applications. To That end I thought it
would be fun to create a way to save and manipulate collection of opml style rss feeds.

## Getting Started

To use this application, you will need to have a basic understanding of both CloverDB and HTMX.
If you're unfamiliar with these technologies, you can find more information and resources online.

To get started, simply clone this repository and open the kick off the task file

## Features

This app includes several features that allow you to experiment with CloverDB and HTMX:

    1. Real-time data updates: Using CloverDB, this app allows you to make real-time updates to the data displayed in the app.

    2. Dynamic page updates: Using HTMX, this app allows you to dynamically update the page content without requiring a full page refresh.

    3. Interactive elements: The app includes several interactive elements, such as buttons and input fields, that you can use to experiment with different HTMX features.

    4. Code examples: The app includes several code examples that demonstrate how to use CloverDB and HTMX to build dynamic, reactive web applications.
