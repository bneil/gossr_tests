## Ideas and Designs

The ability to create a 'blogroll' is defined as a title, description, tag and any other design specs
that could make it easier to sort. This would be all for optimal to use in organizing. The actual opml 2.0 spec
could also use the information however id like to make that more of a game. 

So you can add individual feeds, or an opml file. Either case, testing the validaty of the xml feed and
pulling some of the latest articles would be neat. As well as just having a large directory of feeds to source.
